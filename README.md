# Parametrization-conic-sections
Offers a menu type interface for plotting conic sections

- this project offers some geometric representation of conic sections using geometric parametrizations, translation with vectors and rotations
- each section has its own reprezentation, it being offered in an independent iteration inside the repoistory, which contains all the needed functions for the parametrizations

# additional documentation is provided inside the modules
